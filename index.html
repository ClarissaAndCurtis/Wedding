          <div class="contentText">
              <p>I (Clarissa) am from beautiful Newport, New York, the youngest of six children and the proud aunt of two nieces and four nephews. &nbsp;I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a B.S. in Management and Technology and currently work in Business Development. &nbsp;In addition to Curtis, my mother and siblings are my very best friends and the greatest family anyone could ask for.</p><br />
              <p>I (Curtis) am from Hoffman Estates, Illinois, which is about thirty miles from downtown Chicago. &nbsp;I have one older brother, Alan, who is also my best friend. &nbsp;I graduated from the University of Illinois with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and currently work developing manufacturing technology. &nbsp;I have great parents- hence them supporting me in every new hobby I gain (mountain and rock climbing, fishing, scouts, hunting, golfing, etc.).</p><br />
              <p>We met and both currently live in Rockford, IL, which is eighty-five miles west of Chicago. &nbsp;We have been together since 2011 and were engaged to be wed in December 2014. &nbsp;Our faith and families continue to be the most important things in our lives. &nbsp;We enjoy spending time with our many friends, traveling, finding new restaurants, entertaining, watching sports, attending horse races, boating, riding our bikes (Ok, this is Clarissa but Curtis is nice enough to come along) and outdoor activities (this is mostly fishing, hunting, etc. and mostly just Curtis actually). &nbsp;We are looking forward to beginning our life together!</p><br />
